You and Yummy Noodle Bar have come a long way!

## Quick Recap and What's Next

Here's what you did to build your RESTful web service:

* Constructed a RESTful Integration domain that effectively encapsulates the concerns of a RESTful API without corrupting the core components of the Yummy Noodle Bar. 
* Designed your RESTful resources, including their URIs, the HTTP methods they support and the HTTP status codes that they respond with.
* Implemented those RESTful resources using Spring MVC controllers.
* Used content negotiation to respond with the right resource representation according to what a client has requested.
* Ran your RESTful service using Gradle as well as packaged your service as a WAR file.
* Tested your RESTful service functionality with Spring's `RestTemplate`.
* Secured your service's URIs from access by unauthorized clients.
* Implemented HATEOAS to make your services' resources and relationships between those resources discoverable by your clients.

 Reflecting the different domains you've been working in and how they relate to the core of the Yummy Noodle Bar application, the final life preserver looks like this:
